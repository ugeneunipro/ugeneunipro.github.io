                When you work with a circular sequence, don&#8217;t forget to check &#8220;Mark as circular&#8221; in the Project View. In this case all

            The webinars are mostly useful to people with small experience in using UGENE or without the experience at all. However, experienced users
            may also find them&nbsp;useful, as they provide some tips on using UGENE.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approximate&nbsp;plan of the webinars is the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                UGENE basics
            </li>
            <li>
                Analyzing a sequence
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiple sequence alignment
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition, each webinar will take into account preferences of the participants. The participants will also be able to ask questions
            throughout the webinar.&nbsp;The webinars are free of charge.

            The latest UGENE 1.11 version is a major release that provides dozens of new features (major and minor), bug fixes and a set of usability
            and other improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major changes are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The Sequence View was extended with an options panel. It shows interactive information about a selected sequence region, allows you to
                easily set up the annotation types&#39; properties (for example annotations&#39; colors) and to search for a pattern in a sequence.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can now calculate a consensus sequence for assembly data in the Assembly Browser, using either a simple default algorithm or an
                algorithm from SAMtools. Also, it is now possible to highlight paired reads and SNP in assembly data. Another minor handy feature is the
                possibility to add bookmarks in the Assembly Browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                To create more sophisticated workflows in the Workflow Designer you can use new data flow elements Grouper and Multiplexer.
            </li>
            <li>
                An mRNA-to-genomic alignment program Spidey was embedded into UGENE as an external tool.
            </li>
            <li>
                UGENE 64-bit version is now available for Windows.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To overview the changes you can watch &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2bwKV7o2Kg" target="_blank">Whats new in UGENE

            analysis and visualization of the data generated by Illumina technologies in the context of cancer genome research. For this challenge we
            presented the UGENE&nbsp;<a href="http://ugene.unipro.ru/documentation/manual/assembly_browser.html">Assembly Browser</a>, a
            neat BAM viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final of Illumina iDEA 2011 challenge took place in San Diego, CA, USA on the 14-15th June 2011. During the Illumina iDEA 2011
            conference the finalists and guest scientists gave their talks about future of Next Generation Sequencing.

    <div>
        <p>
            A training workshop on UGENE organized by Unipro and Novosibirsk State University was held between the 30th May and 2nd June. A group of
            young biologists from several Siberian universities and research labs gathered together to study on how to work with UGENE and use the
            toolkit in their everyday research.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img alt="Tutorial on Workflow Designer" src="/assets/images/news/fcp2011_small.png" style="width: 512px;"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop covered various topics in bioinformatics: homology searching in databases, performing multiple alignment, working with NGS data
            and much more. An important goal of the workshop was to familiarize scientists with the usage of high-performance computing. The
            participants also learned the innovative concepts of&nbsp;<a href="http://ugene.net/documentation/wd_manual/index.html">Workflow
            Desinger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://ugene.net/documentation/qd_manual/index.html">Query Designer</a>. The lectures
            and tutorial sessions were conducted by UGENE team members and experienced scientists from NSU and local research institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop was supported by a grant from Russian Federal Targeted Program пїЅR&amp;D in Priority Fields of the S&amp;T Complex of
