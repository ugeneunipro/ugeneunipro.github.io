        To optimize the process of releasing new UGENE versions we&#8217;re thinking of keeping only one online and one offline UGENE installer
        package for 64-bit versions of operating systems Windows, Linux, macOS.

        &#8220;&#8230;The new UGENE v.1.31 release offers graphical, user-friendly wrapping of a number of popular command-line metagenomics
        classification programs (Kraken, CLARK, DIAMOND), combinable serially and in parallel through the workflow designer, with multiple,

        form of detailed table reports. Pre-built workflows (which include all steps from data cleaning to summaries) are included with the
        installation and a tutorial is available on the UGENE website. Further expansion with multiple visualization tools for reports is

<div>
    <p>
        The webinars are mostly useful to people with small experience in using UGENE or without the experience at all. However, experienced users
        may also find them&nbsp;useful, as they provide some tips on using UGENE.
    </p>
    <p>
        Approximate&nbsp;plan of the webinars is the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            UGENE basics
        </li>
        <li>
            Analyzing a sequence
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiple sequence alignment
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, each webinar will take into account preferences of the participants. The participants will also be able to ask questions
        throughout the webinar.&nbsp;The webinars are free of charge.

    <p>
        The latest UGENE 1.11 version is a major release that provides dozens of new features (major and minor), bug fixes and a set of usability
        and other improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The major changes are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Sequence View was extended with an options panel. It shows interactive information about a selected sequence region, allows you to
            easily set up the annotation types&#39; properties (for example annotations&#39; colors) and to search for a pattern in a sequence.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can now calculate a consensus sequence for assembly data in the Assembly Browser, using either a simple default algorithm or an
            algorithm from SAMtools. Also, it is now possible to highlight paired reads and SNP in assembly data. Another minor handy feature is the
            possibility to add bookmarks in the Assembly Browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            To create more sophisticated workflows in the Workflow Designer you can use new data flow elements Grouper and Multiplexer.
        </li>
        <li>
            An mRNA-to-genomic alignment program Spidey was embedded into UGENE as an external tool.
        </li>
        <li>
            UGENE 64-bit version is now available for Windows.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To overview the changes you can watch &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2bwKV7o2Kg" target="_blank">Whats new in UGENE

<div>
    <p>
        A training workshop on UGENE organized by Unipro and Novosibirsk State University was held between the 30th May and 2nd June. A group of
        young biologists from several Siberian universities and research labs gathered together to study on how to work with UGENE and use the
        toolkit in their everyday research.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img alt="Tutorial on Workflow Designer" src="/assets/images/news/fcp2011_small.png" style="width: 512px;"/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop covered various topics in bioinformatics: homology searching in databases, performing multiple alignment, working with NGS data
        and much more. An important goal of the workshop was to familiarize scientists with the usage of high-performance computing. The
        participants also learned the innovative concepts of&nbsp;<a href="http://ugene.net/documentation/wd_manual/index.html">Workflow
        Desinger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://ugene.net/documentation/qd_manual/index.html">Query Designer</a>. The lectures
        and tutorial sessions were conducted by UGENE team members and experienced scientists from NSU and local research institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The workshop was supported by a grant from Russian Federal Targeted Program пїЅR&amp;D in Priority Fields of the S&amp;T Complex of
        RussiaпїЅ.</p>
