                There are a lot of good features that we would like to include in UGENE, but sometimes we don&#39;t have enough resources to implement all the
                features as soon as you would like them to have. So if you want a feature to be implemented as soon as possible you can use this paid service.
                The new feature can be either a minor improvement or a big change. Depending on the requirements the feature can be either included into the
                common UGENE package, so everyone would be able to use it, or it can be customization available only for you.
